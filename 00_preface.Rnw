\chapter{Goals and philosophy}
This script aims to provide students and researchers in the humanities 
and social sciences with foundational statistical knowledge. 
It is intended to be useful both for reading quantitative research reports 
and for designing and analysing your own studies.  
Before we dive in, I'd like to explain the guiding principles 
behind this script and what you can expect from it.  

\paragraph{Current practice vs best practice}
At least in applied linguistics, my own research area, 
there is a substantial gap between how statistical analyses 
are actually carried out and reported, and how they ideally should be.  
Exactly what contributes to this gap is somewhat a matter of opinion. 
Here is my tuppence-worth:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many articles inundate readers with a flood of significance tests. 
  Most of these are only marginally relevant to the research questions.
  Readers must therefore separate the relevant from the irrelevant 
  information---a responsibility that ought to lie with the authors.  
  I suspect that this overabundance of trivial information stems from researchers
  following a formulaic approach to data analysis. 
  They often do not consider whether the calculations they perform 
  and report actually make sense in the context of their study.
  
  \item Despite the large volume of numbers in research reports, 
  readers often learn very little about the data themselves 
  or the relationships between variables.  
  The dangers of blind number crunching are illustrated 
  in several exercises in this script.
  
  \item Outputs of statistical models are sometimes interpreted too eagerly 
  in terms of the study's theories and hypotheses, 
  without a clear understanding of what all these numbers \emph{literally} mean.  
  Linking results to theory is desirable, of course. 
  But without understanding the literal meaning of the model output, 
  there is a high risk of self-deception.  
  Accordingly, this script includes several exercises in which readers 
  must explain the literal meaning of numbers in model output.
  
  \item Some researchers lose sight of their primary 
  goal---answering a research question---when applying 
  more complex statistical methods.
  They may treat the application of the method itself as the goal.  
  (Admittedly, I sometimes fall into this trap as well.)
\end{itemize}

This script will not dwell excessively on 
common questionable or pointless practices.
However, several exercises are designed as a safeguard against them.  
Still, it is advisable to familiarise yourself with these practices at some point 
(see Chapters \ref{ch:sinnlos} and \ref{ch:QRP} and the recommended reading).

\paragraph{Curb your enthusiasm.}
Many widespread questionable practices probably persist 
because researchers in the humanities and social sciences overestimate 
what statistical methods can achieve.  
A seemingly sophisticated statistical analysis cannot rescue 
poorly planned or executed data collection.  
Therefore, foundational knowledge of research design is often more important 
than purely statistical skills (see my other script, \href{https://github.com/janhove/QuantitativeMethodology}{\textit{Quantitative methodology: An introduction}}).  
Do not expect that an elaborate statistical analysis 
will provide a useful answer to a poorly formulated research question.

\paragraph{Content.}
Chapter \ref{ch:software} explains how to properly set up the software we will use (R and RStudio)
and is intended as self-study.
Experience shows that students often struggle to structure datasets for easy analysis. 
Chapter \ref{ch:datasets} is devoted to these steps.  
You will also learn several useful commands to import, rearrange, and merge datasets in R.

Chapter \ref{ch:probability} imparts the fundamentals of probability theory,
which is then applied in Chapters \ref{ch:univariate}, \ref{ch:samples}, and \ref{ch:uncertainty} 
on descriptive statistics, parameter estimation, and the estimation of uncertainty,
respectively.  
Concepts such as sampling error and confidence intervals are illustrated primarily 
through simulations and related methods.  
I hope that this approach clarifies the concepts and makes 
the underlying assumptions more transparent 
than a purely mathematical explanation would.  
That said, this script doesn't shy away from some of the more accessible mathematical proofs.
The rationale for providing these proofs is to make it clear that the procedures
discussed are the result of reason and not of decree.

In Chapters \ref{ch:linmod} to \ref{ch:multimod}, 
we examine a key tool in statistical practice: the general linear model.  
Most statistical procedures you will encounter in 
the social and humanities sciences are instances of this model or its generalisations.

While I do not deny occasional usefulness of significance tests, 
I consider them often overused.  
To prevent readers from thinking that $p$-values are the be-all and end-all of analysis, 
they aren't introduced until Chapter \ref{ch:logic}, alongside many caveats.

Chapters \ref{ch:withinsubjects} to \ref{ch:weiterbildung} 
provide recommendations for exploring more complex methods 
that, in my view, do not belong to the basics.  
Many procedures occasionally seen in social and humanities research 
remain entirely unmentioned.  
My hope is that readers who have worked through this script 
will be able to acquire such methods independently from other introductions.

The appendix
contains explanations of common R error messages and an overview of the software versions used.

\paragraph{Prerequisites.}
I work in a Department of Multilingualism Research and Foreign Language Didactics. 
Students in our programmes generally have minimal experience with quantitative data analysis.  
This script assumes no prior knowledge in this area.  
It does assume, however, that readers don't freeze up when confronted with
with some mathematical notation. 
Most equations are implemented in software commands, 
which should make their meaning more transparent.

\paragraph{Learning how to learn.}
I assume a healthy dose of curiosity and initiative.  
I have tried to explain most of the settings in software commands. 
If a setting is unclear, 
consult the commandâ€™s help page or experiment by changing it to see how the output changes.

Curiosity and initiative are essential 
because it is impossible to convey all relevant insights in a single script---even one of over 300 pages long.  
The aim is to provide you with the foundations to acquire further knowledge independently.  
You will find many literature recommendations throughout; 
approach them as a reading programme over several years.  
Many of the concepts discussed here are also featured on my blog, \url{https://janhove.github.io}.

Simulations are an extremely useful tool for learning statistics.  
We will analyse existing datasets and generate our own.  
Simulations allow you to know exactly how the data were generated and see how this affects model output.  
Experiment with and modify these simulations---you will learn a great deal from doing so.  
When learning new techniques, 
first apply them to simulated datasets to ensure you truly understand the output.

\paragraph{Script under revision.}
This script represents the latest iteration of a manuscript 
I have worked on since 2012 and is likely not the last.  
The previous versions were in German, but I decided to make use of the last
round of revisions to translate the whole thing into English.
I used ChatGPT to draft a translation for several of the chapters.

I welcome any content- or language-related feedback.  
Special thanks to Isabelle Udry,
who pointed out numerous linguistic errors 
and unclear passages in one of the more recent versions, 
which I then promptly replaced by others.

Good luck, stay patient with yourself, and enjoy the process! :)
