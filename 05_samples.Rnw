\chapter{Random samples}\label{ch:samples}
When you've specified a probability distribution,
you can make probabilistic claims about random variables
that are distributed according to this distribution.
\term{Inferential statistics}, though, is concerned with the inverse problem:
Having observed some random variables (i.e., data points), what conclusions can we draw about
the probability distribution they follow?

This probability distribution could correspond to some population
that we want to learn something about.
For instance, the population in question could be all Swiss citizens with the vote, 
and we'd like to figure out what percentage of them will
vote in favour of the next federal referendum.
Often, though, it makes more sense to think of the probability distribution not as a literal 
population, but as an abstract data-generating mechanism: 
a theoretical model that connects the data we see 
to the real-world process we want to study.
For instance, an astronomer could make a series of imperfect measurements
about a celestial body's trajectory.
The theoretical data-generating mechanism would then spell out how the trajectory
and the imperfect measurements are presumed to be related to one another.
The imperfect measurements can then be used to estimate the specifics of the trajectory.

Typically, the data collected are only a small part of the data that could
have been collected---be it because the population of interest is much larger
or because the abstract data-generating mechanism could in principle generate
an infinite amount of data.
Such limited collections of data are known as \term{samples},
and they necessarily only give you an incomplete picture about the distribution
from which they stem.
The goal of inferential statistics, then, is to use samples to infer properties
about the parent distributions.
Consequently, it's not so much, say, the central tendency and the spread
in the sample that's of interest, but rather the central tendency and the
spread of the parent distribution.

In the following, we assume that we have access to a (simple) random sample
and that the parent distribution is either a data-generating mechanism
capable of producing an infinite amount of data or a population that can
for all intents and purposes be considered infinitely large.

\mypar{Definition}
  Let $P$ be a probability distribution. Then a \term{(simple) random sample}
  from $P$ of size $n$ consists of independent random variables 
  $X_1, \dots, X_n$ that are all distributed according to $P$.
\parend

This chapter focuses on the estimation of the central tendency
of the parent distribution $P$ (in particular its expected value)
as well as its spread (in particular its variance and standard deviation)
by means of a random sample.
In practice, though, you rarely come across truly random samples;
we'll discuss this further at the end of this chapter.

\section{Sampling error}
Random samples don't perfectly reflect every aspect of their parent distribution.
To better appreciate this, 
we'll draw some random samples from distributions whose properties we know
and see how different they look both from each other
and from their parent distributions.

\mypar[Normal distribution]{Activity}\label{activity:normal}
  The commands below draw nine random samples of size 20
  from a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 7
  and plot these in histograms.
<<eval = FALSE>>=
size <- 20
mu <- 3
sigma <- 7

par(mfrow = c(3, 3)) # multiple graphs in one plot
for (i in 1:9) {
  x <- rnorm(n = size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  hist(x, main = paste0("Sample ", i), freq = FALSE)
}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # back to default plotting
@

  Run these commands a couple of times, also varying the sample sizes.
  Pay attention to the differences between the histograms as well as to
  how dissimilar they are to the normal distribution's bell-shaped density function.
\parend

\mypar[Uniform distribution]{Exercise}
  Adapt the code from Activity \ref{activity:normal}
  in such a way that it draws and plots random samples
  from a continuous uniform distribution on $[-5, 5]$.
  Run the code a couple of times, varying the sample size.
  Again pay attention to the differences between the histograms
  as well as to how dissimilar these are to the uniform distribution's flat density function.
\parend

In sum, random samples reflect the distributions 
from which they are drawn imperfectly.
This fact is referred to as \term{sampling error}.
Consequently, any inferences we draw about the parent distribution 
based on a random sample are estimates.
Inferential statistics is concerned both with coming up with good estimation
techniques as well as with quantifying the inherent uncertainty about the
resulting estimates.

\section{Estimating the expected value}
In the following, we assume that the distribution $P$ that we've drawn a random
sample from has an expected value (mean) and finite variance.
As we've seen in Chapter \ref{ch:univariate}, 
given a random sample $\bm X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$ from $P$, 
we can define the empirical distribution $\widehat P$ of $\bm X$.
A natural way to estimate properties of $P$ is to calculate the corresponding
properties of $\widehat P$.
This raises the question of how good such so-called \textit{plug-in} estimators are.

\mypar[Estimand, estimate, estimator]{Definition}
  An \term{estimand} is a numerical property of a distribution
  that we want to estimate using data.
  
  An \term{estimate} is a number that is based on data and prior knowledge
  and that is intended as an approximation of an estimand.
  
  An \term{estimator} is an algorithm that specifies how data and prior
  knowledge are to be combined in order to produce an estimate.
\parend

For instance, the (unknown) expected value of a distribution $P$ could
be one's estimand of interest.
A popular estimator would then be the instruction `sum all observations in the
sample and divide the sum by the number of observations'.
Since this is precisely how you'd compute the expected value of $\widehat P$,
this estimator is the plug-in estimator of the expected value.
The resulting number is the corresponding estimate.

We can't make general claims about specific estimates.
But we can meaningfully compare different estimators 
on a number of quality criteria.
The most important of these are the estimator's bias, consistency, and variance.

\mypar[Bias]{Definition}
  Consider an estimator $g$ and estimand $\theta$ of a distribution $P$.
  The \term{bias} of $g$ as an estimator of $\theta$ is defined to be
  \[
    \E(g(X_1, \dots, X_n)) - \theta,
  \]
  where $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are independently distributed according to $P$.
  
  If $\E(g(X_1, \dots, X_n)) = \theta$ for each possible value of $\theta$,
  then $g$ is known as an \term{unbiased} estimator of $\theta$.
\parend

In other words, an unbiased estimator yields the correct answer on average.

To give a precise definition of consistency,
we'd have to introduce some further mathematical concepts.
For our purposes, though, the following more conceptual
definition suffices.

\mypar[Consistency]{Definition}
  An estimator $g$ is a \term{consistent} estimator of $\theta$ if
  \[
    \E\left(|g(X_1, \dots, X_n) - \theta|\right)
  \]
  becomes arbitrarily small for large $n$, for all possible values of $\theta$.
\parend

That is, the differences between the estimates produced by a consistent
estimator and the true parameter value are expected to become negligible
as the sample size increases.

\mypar[Variance of an estimator]{Definition}
  The variance of an estimator $g$ is defined as
  \[
    \Var(g(X_1, \dots, X_n)). \parendeq
  \]

That is, an estimator's variance expresses how much the resulting estimates
vary from sample to sample.

Ideally, estimators are unbiased and consistent, and they should have low variance.
However, not all estimands permit such ideal estimators.
Further, as you'll see in Exercise \ref{ex:estimators},
you can often decrease the variance by sacrificing unbiasedness.
This phenomenon is known as the \term{bias--variance trade-off}.

\mypar[Unbiased but useless]{*Example}
  Unbiased estimators can be inconsistent, rendering them pretty useless
  for practical purposes.
  By way of an example, consider $P = \textrm{Binomial}(n, p)$
  and define $\theta := (1-p)^n$ \citep[][p.\ 49]{Duembgen2016}.
  We observe $X \sim P$.
  One can show that there exists only one unbiased estimator $g(X)$ of $\theta$,
  namely
  \[
    g(X) :=
    \begin{cases}
      1, & \textrm{if $X = 0$}, \\
      0, & \textrm{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
  \]
  But depending on $p$, $\theta$ can take on any value in the interval $[0,1]$.
  The value of $g(X)$, by contrast, is always either 0 or 1.
  As a result, $g$ is not a consistent estimator of $\theta$.
\parend

The \term{sample mean} is the expected value of the sample's empirical distribution.
It serves as an estimate of the parent distribution's expected value $\mu$:
\[
  \widehat{\mu} := \overline{X} := \frac{1}{n}(X_1 + \dots + X_n).
\]
In Section \ref{sec:clt}, we showed that
\[
  \E(\overline{X}) = \mu.
\]
Consequently, 
the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the parent distribution's expected value.
Further, we know that the variance of $\overline{X}$ equals
$\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$, where $\sigma^2$ is the parent distribution's variance.
Hence, the variance of $\overline{X}$ becomes arbitrarily small for large $n$.
This combined with the unbiasedness of the sample mean implies
that the sample mean is a consistent estimator of $\mu$.
Finally, the Gauss--Markov theorem tells us that, among all linear unbiased
estimators of the population's expected value, the sample mean is the one
with the lowest variance.\footnote{Given a data vector $\bm X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$,
a linear estimator $g(\bm X)$ can be written as
$g(\bm X) = w_1X_1 + \dots + w_nX_n$ for certain coefficients $w_1, \dots, w_n$.
For the sample mean, $w_1 = \dots = w_n = 1/n$.}

\mypar[Gauss--Markov]{Theorem}\label{th:gauss}
  Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a simple random sample from a distribution $P$.
  Then each linear unbiased estimator $g(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ of $\mu$ satisfies
  \[
    \Var(\overline{X}) \leq \Var(g(X_1, \dots, X_n)). \parendeq
  \]

It is, however, sometimes possible to come up with linear unbiased estimators
with lower variance if the sample is not a simple random sample.

\mypar{Example}
  Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be independent Bernoulli($p$)-distributed
  random variables.
  Then $\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + \dots + X_n)$ is an unbiased and consistent estimator
  of $p$.
  Among all linear unbiased estimators of $p$, it has the lowest variance.
\parend

\mypar[Weighted mean]{Example}\label{example:weightedmean}
  We assume that $P_1, P_2$ are distributions with the same unknown mean
  $\mu$, but different and known variances:
  $\Var(P_1) = 1, \Var(P_2) = 4$.
  We now observe independent random variables
  $X_1 \sim P_1, X_2 \sim P_2$ and want to use these to estimate $\mu$.
  
  The first option is to estimate $\mu$ as the mean of $X_1, X_2$.
  This estimator is unbiased as
  \[
    \E\left(\frac{X_1 + X_2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}(\E(X_1) + \E(X_2)) = \frac{1}{2}(\mu + \mu) = \mu.
  \]
  Since $X_1, X_2$ are independent, the variance of this estimator
  is easily calculated:
  \[
    \Var\left(\frac{X_1 + X_2}{2}\right)
    = \frac{1}{4}(\Var(X_1) + \Var(X_2)) = \frac{5}{4}.
  \]
  
  A second option is to just ignore $X_2$ and use the value of $X_1$
  as the estimate of $\mu$. This estimator, too, is unbiased: $\E(X_1) = \mu$.
  Furthermore, its variance is lower than that of the first estimator:
  $\Var(X_1) = 1 < 5/4$.
  
  But it would be even better to weight the observations $X_1, X_2$
  by the inverses of their variance:
  \[
    g(X_1, X_2) := \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{4}}\left(X_1 + \frac{1}{4}X_2\right) = \frac{4}{5}\left(X_1 + \frac{1}{4}X_2\right).
  \]
  This estimator is also unbiased:
  \[
   \E(g(X_1, X_2)) = \frac{4}{5}\left(\E(X_1) + \frac{1}{4}\E(X_2)\right) = \mu.
  \]
  However, its variance is lower:
  \[
    \Var(g(X_1, X_2))
    = \frac{4^2}{5^2}\left(\Var(X_1) + \frac{1}{4^2}\Var(X_2)\right)
    = \frac{4}{5}.
  \]
  The Gauss--Markov theorem does not apply here since $X_1, X_2$
  do not represent a simple random sample: The observations stem from
  different distributions.
  
  This example corresponds to the realistic scenario in which
  two random samples are drawn from the same distribution
  with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, but we only know
  their sample means $X_1, X_2$ and their sample sizes $n_1, n_2$.
  In this case, $X_1, X_2$ are distributed with the same mean $\mu$
  but different variances $\sigma^2/n_1$ and $\sigma^2/n_2$.
  The expected value of the parent distribution is then best estimated
  using the weighted mean.
\parend

\mypar[Comparison of estimators of $\mu$]{*Exercise}\label{ex:estimators}
  Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a simple random sample from a distribution $P$
  with expected value $\mu$ and with finite variance.
  Decide for each of the estimators below if they estimate $\mu$ in an unbiased way,
  if they are consistent, and if their variance is smaller or larger than that of the sample mean $\overline X$.
  You may assume in the following that $\Prob(X_1 = X_2) = 0$;
  you may also use the fact that $1/n$ becomes arbitrarily small for large $n$.
  \begin{align*}
    g_1(X_1, \dots, X_n) &:= X_1; \\
    g_2(X_1, \dots, X_n) &:= \overline{X} + \frac{1}{n}; \\
    g_3(X_1, \dots, X_n) &:= \frac{n-1}{n}\overline{X}; \\
    g_4(X_1, \dots, X_n) &:=
    \begin{cases}
      \overline{X} - 1, & \textrm{if $X_1 < X_2$}, \\
      \overline{X},     & \textrm{if $X_1 = X_2$}, \\
      \overline{X} + 1, & \textrm{if $X_1 > X_2$}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  Which of the estimators above could potentially be practically useful?

  In addition,
  define an estimator $g_5$ that estimates $\mu$ in an unbiased and consistent way,
  but that has a larger variance than the sample mean.

\section{Estimating the variance and the standard deviation}
The previous section showed that the plug-in estimator of the expected value
has excellent properties.
We'll now check if the plug-in estimator of the variance excels similarly.
To that end, we consider a random sample $X_1, \dots, X_n$
from a continuous uniform distribution on $[-5, 5]$.
The variance of this distribution is
\[
  \sigma^2  = \frac{(5 - (-5))^2}{12} \approx 8.33.
\]
The function \texttt{var\_one\_run()} defined below generates a 
single random sample of size \texttt{n} from this distribution and 
computes the plug-in estimate of the variance.
The \texttt{sim\_var()} function runs \texttt{var\_one\_run()} a couple
of thousand times and outputs the mean of the variance estimates.
<<>>=
var_one_run <- function(n, min = -5, max = 5) {
  x <- runif(n, min = min, max = max)
  mean(x^2) - mean(x)^2
}
sim_var <- function(n_sample, min = -5, max = 5, n_runs = 50000) {
  sample_vars <- replicate(n_runs, 
                           var_one_run(n = n_sample, min = min, max = max))
  mean(sample_vars)
}
@

For $n = 25$, we obtain the following mean variance estimate:
<<>>=
sim_var(n_sample = 25)
@
Since this number is based on random sampling, you'll obtain a slightly different
result.

\mypar[Varying $n$]{Activity}\label{ex:estimate_var}
  Run the same simulation for $n = 16, 9, 4, 1$.
  You don't have to make any changes to \texttt{var\_one\_run()}
  or \texttt{sim\_var()}!
  Compare the mean variance estimate you obtain for each $n$ to the 
  estimand's true value of $\sigma^2 \approx 8.33$.
\parend

As this simulation illustrates, the plug-in estimator of the variance
is biased: On average, it produces estimates that are lower
than the estimand's true value.
This bias is more pronounced in smaller samples.
As the next lemma shows, for a sample of size $n$, the bias of the (`naive') 
plug-in estimator $s_n^2$ has a negative bias of $\sigma^2/n$.
This naive estimator is, however, consistent.

\mypar[Bias of the naive variance estimator]{*Lemma}
  Let $\bm X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$ be simple random sample from a distribution $P$
  with expected value $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2 < \infty$.
  Denote by $\overline X$ the sample mean of $\bm X$.
  Then
  \[
    s^2_n(\bm X) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left(X_i - \overline X\right)^2
  \]
  is a biased estimator of $\sigma^2$.
  Specifically,
  \[
    \E\left(s^2_n(\bm X)\right) = \frac{n-1}{n}\sigma^2. \parendeq
  \]
\begin{proof}
  We have
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left(X_i - \overline X\right)^2 
    &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left((X_i - \mu) - (\overline X - \mu)\right)^2 \\
    &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2 - \frac{2(\overline X - \mu) }{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)
        + \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\overline X - \mu)^2 \\
    &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2 - 2(\overline X - \mu)^2 + (\overline X - \mu)^2 \\
    &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2 - (\overline X - \mu)^2.
  \end{align*}
  These identities can be verified by applying the binomial formula $(a - b)^2 = a^2-2ab+b^2$
  and using $\overline X = (\sum_{i=1}^n X_i)/n$.
  
  Taking the expected values on both sides, we obtain
  \begin{align*}
    \E\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left(X_i - \overline X\right)^2 \right)
    &= \E\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \mu)^2 - (\overline X - \mu)^2\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\underbrace{\E (X_i - \mu)^2}_{= \Var(X_i) = \sigma^2} - \underbrace{\E\left((\overline X - \mu)^2\right)}_{= \Var(\overline X) = \sigma^2/n} \\
    &= \sigma^2 - \sigma^2/n \\
    &= \frac{n-1}{n}\sigma^2. \qedhere
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

The lemma suggests a straightforward way to correct the naive variance estimator
so that it becomes unbiased: Multiply its estimates by the factor $n/(n-1)$.
This results in the sample variance that was already introduced in the previous chapter:
\[
  s^2(\bm X) = \frac{n}{n-1}s_n^2(\bm X) = \frac{n}{n-1}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \overline X)^2\right) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \overline X)^2.
\]
The estimator $s^2$ estimates $\sigma^2$ in an unbiased and consistent way;
we won't prove consistency, however. It can be computed using \texttt{var()}.

While the central limit theorem allows us to make approximate claims about
the distribution of the sample mean,
the corresponding theorem about the large-sample distribution of the 
sample variance is less practically useful.
For samples drawn from a normal distribution, however, precise claims can
be made. These are introduced in the following optional paragraphs.

\mypar{*Remark}\label{remark:chisq}
  Let $Z_1, \dots, Z_n$ be independent random variables following a standard
  normal distribution.
  Then the distribution of $Z_1^2 + \dots + Z_n^2$ is called 
  the \term{chi-squared distribution} with $n$ degrees of freedom.
  We write $\chi^2_n$. 
  Figure \ref{fig:dchisq} shows density functions of a few $\chi^2$-distributions.
  
  Now, if $\bm X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$ is a simple random sample drawn from a normal
  distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then it can be shown
  that the quantity
  \[
    (n-1)\frac{s^2(\bm X)}{\sigma^2}
  \]
  follows a $\chi^2_{n-1}$-distribution.
  We can use this fact to make probabilistic claims about the sample variance
  of normally distributed data.
  For instance, if we draw a random sample of size $n = 10$ from a
  $\mathcal{N}(3, 12)$-distribution, and we want to know the probability
  that the sample variance will be no greater than 14, then we proceed as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \Prob\left(s^2(\bm X) \leq 14\right)
    &= \Prob\left(\frac{10-1}{12} s^2(\bm X) \leq \frac{(10-1)14}{12}\right) \\
    &= \Prob\left(\frac{n-1}{\sigma^2} s(\bm X)^2 \leq 10.5\right) \\
    &= \Prob(H^2 \leq 10.5),
  \end{align*}
  where $H^2 \sim \chi_{9}^2$. 
  We use R to compute the exact value:

pchisq(10.5, df = 9)

That is, about 69\%.

For the same reason why the sample variance is used instead of the 
naive plug-in estimator when estimating the variance of a distribution,
the sample standard deviation is used instead of the naive plug-in estimator
when estimating the standard deviation of a distribution:
\[
 s(\bm X) = \sqrt{s^2(\bm X)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (X_i - \overline X)^2}.
\]
The R function \texttt{sd()} implements this formula.\label{comment:sd}
The sample standard deviation is a consistent estimator of the distribution's
standard deviation.
However, it is \emph{not} an unbiased estimator.
Even though the sample variance estimates the distribution variance in an unbiased way,
the sample standard deviation still underestimates the distribution standard deviation
slightly.
Correcting for this bias is difficult at best and usually impossible,
but it is of little practical importance.\footnote{Just because $g(X_1, \dots, X_n)$
estimates the estimand $\theta$ in an unbiased way, doesn't mean that $h(g(X_1, \dots, X_n))$
estimates the estimand $h(\theta)$ in an unbiased way.
For instance, $\overline X$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$,
but $(\overline X)^2$ overestimates $\mu^2$. 
To convince yourself of this, 
consider a distribution with $\Prob(X = -1) = \Prob(X = 1)$.}

\mypar{*Exercise}
  Let $\bm X = (X_1, \dots, X_{10})$ be a simple random sample from
  a $\mathcal{N}(-4, 8)$-distribution.
  Compute the probability that $s(\bm X)$ is at least 3.5.
  To this end, you can proceed as in Remark \ref{remark:chisq}.

\section{Non-random samples}\label{sec:nonrandom}
Random samples have two major advantages: 
they yield unbiased estimates of the population mean and variance, 
and they allow us to apply mathematical results such as the central limit theorem.

In practice, however, drawing a genuine random sample from 
any reasonably interesting population is extremely difficult.
Take, for example, the task of assessing the English proficiency of adults of 
Kosovar origin in the canton of St.\ Gallen. 
To obtain a random sample, 
we would first need a complete list of all such adults in the canton. 
From that list, we would randomly select a group 
and then persuade all of them to take part in the study. 
But as soon as someone refuses, 
the sample is no longer random with respect to the original population. 
What we end up with is a sample of those who are willing to participate, 
not of all adults of Kosovar origin in St.\ Gallen. 
Our estimates therefore apply primarily to this new population, 
not to the one we initially set out to study.
Furthermore, the sample would not consist of independent observations, 
since each individual can only be selected once.

This example highlights an important consequence: 
while a random sample 
provides an unbiased estimate of the mean of the true population of interest, 
nonresponse can distort results. 
In our case, refusals may come disproportionately 
from people who consider their English weak 
or who find linguistic research irrelevant. 
Those who remain are likely to have stronger English skills 
or a greater interest in languages. 
As a result, the sample mean will 
tend to overestimate the average ability in the target population.

In short, social science researchers rarely work with true random samples. 
Instead, they rely on non-random samples,
which means that far more care is needed 
when interpreting results and generalising them to a broader population.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Social media surveys tend to reach people who share similar views. 
        Even the most reputable polling institutes face the same problem: 
        In the U.S., for instance, fewer than 10\% of people contacted 
        in telephone surveys actually respond, according to an \href{https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/02/27/response-rates-in-telephone-surveys-have-resumed-their-decline/}{article}
        published by the Pew Research Center.
  \item A person who completes a long questionnaire 
        on their multilingual behaviour without compensation 
        is likely to value multilingualism more than someone who closes 
        the browser after three questions---or never receives the questionnaire 
        at all, when snowball sampling is used.
  \item Findings from a sample of highly educated, 
        relatively affluent individuals (such as most university students) 
        may not generalise to populations with lower levels of education 
        or socioeconomic status. 
        This is especially problematic 
        when these factors are directly relevant to the research question. 
        If we are willing to assume that they have only a minimal effect, 
        generalisation may be defensible---but 
        whether that assumption is justified is a matter of subject-matter knowledge, not statistics.

So should you despair and toss these lecture notes into the camp fire 
halfway through the semester? 

I'd wait till the end of the semester, if I were you.

On the one hand, 
the ideal case of the random sample provides a useful model for thinking about data. 
When the data-generating process in a particular study does not fit that ideal, 
the model can often be refined to better capture the reality at hand. 
On the other hand, many of the insights still transfer well to common research 
settings---for instance, experiments in which participants are not a random sample of any population
but in which they \emph{are} randomly assigned to conditions within the study.
